# Kubernetes examples

This is my personal repository where I put resources I use to experiment and learn new tools, technology or anything that is related to Kubernetes and can be reproduce with coded.

The only purpose of it is to have a repeatable steps for me to imnprove in time. It may contain my specific settings, random notes, some documentation or nothibng beside pure code. With some small effort it should be also reproducible for anyone - it's just not my first priority.
